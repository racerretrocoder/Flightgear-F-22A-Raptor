The FCR on the MFD's is the radar screen

press Shift-R to enable / disable the radar.

r changes the radars range.

Once your selected. Drop a missile and the missile will home to its target. Same for the bombs!

# Radar Modes:
TWS - Track while scan - The default radar mode for pretty much any situation
RWS - Range while scan - This mode allows the radar to search 320NM out!
ACM - Dogfight Mode - Automatically search, and lock targets if positioned into the HUD
SLR - Side Looking Radar - Raptor has advanced SLR'S at the side of the nose to allow for a crazy scan azimuth of 280 degreese. Its possible to lock and fire Aim-120's at bandits that are roughly on your tail!
