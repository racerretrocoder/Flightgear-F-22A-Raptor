# FDM Just keeps getting better and better. Im making my first fbw right now!!

# To install, 
Download the zip, open the zip and rename the aircraft folder to F-22 (notice the Capital F)
Then drag that to C:\Program Files\FlightGear 2020.3\data\Aircraft  

Linux:  Put the F-22 folder in usr/share/games/flightgear/aircraft

Or if you have a custom aircraft folder put F-22 in there


"Or the directory your installed aircrafts are" --uapilot

See the aircraft help in game to learn how to use every single feature in the jet!

A good aircraft has to have a nice help option! very Important

Based upon the F-22 from the FGUK Hangar. And little pictures on google maps near nellis afb

Missile status: They track and shoot just fine. Damage over multiplayer works too, but the target recives no missile alert. and i dont know if there affected by chaff/flare

MK83 JDAMs are on my todo list...
